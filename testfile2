I was standing all alone against the world outside我孤单地站在世界的外头
You were searching
For a place to hide你在寻找藏身之所
Lost and lonely寂寞又迷茫
Now you've given me the will to survive此刻你让我有了生存的愿望
When we're hungry...love will keep us alive当我们饥饿的时候...是爱让我们存活
Don't you worry不用担心
Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride有些时候就让它去吧
The world is changing
Right before your eyes你眼前的世界如白云苍狗
Now I've found you现在我寻到了你
There's no more emptiness inside内心不再空荡
When we're hungry...love will keep us alive当我们饥饿的时候...是爱让我们存活
I would die for you我愿为你而死
Climb the highest mountain刀山火海
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do无所不为
Now I've found you现在我寻到了你
There's no more emptiness inside内心不再空荡
When we're hungry...love will keep us alive当我们饥饿的时候...是爱让我们存活
